from free list,
    remove node
    reassign pointer to free node to a new Data node
    new data node points to the following node, free or Data holding
    effectively one list
    only have to print a single list
how?
    addProgram()?
        find best/worst fit with outside method
        Once nodes are found, redirect the free memory node pointers    
         to/from new data holding node
        Iterate trough based on pages needed (based on parameter)
        Done?
    Reverse is done for deleting programs
